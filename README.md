"CodeSample1(4).nb" programs make a simulation of the J-V curves in ferroelectric tunnel junctions, and computes the TER ratio with/without hysteresis. The code includes analytical wave-function matching between barrier segments (see Appendix in Code), Transfer matrix application to define the transmission amplitudes of electron probability.

In addition you can find an example of Transfer Matrix application for simple rectangular barrier:
file name: ExampleOfTransferMatrixApplication.nb, ExampleOfTransferMatrixApplication.pdf

folder "initial experimental data from VLSI" contains the experimental data as possible input data for other cases

To use files as input, please, place them into "Documents" folder, or inset the related file path into program code.
